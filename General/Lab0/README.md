### Tutorials

__Tutorial 1: Design Thinking__  
<!--- A brief description of what you understand/learned from the tutorial -->  
Design Thinking tutorial emphaises on the design process that students will definitely go through in the job industry. It aims to teach students to not only immediately propose solution but appreciate the process of designing good products which address the needs of the group of interest thoroughly. The goal is to help students understand what it means to understand their end-user's problems since it is a crucial part of coming up with great solutions. It highlights the three major steps behind this idea: Problem definition, Designing a solution, and Building and Testing (which each steps followed by a set of driving thoughts). What's most important from this tutorial, i.e: the keytakeway, is at the end of the tutorial: __"satisfy the unmet user need"__, for that is really the major crucial concept of designing a solution.

__Tutorial 2: Git__  
<!--- A brief description of what you understand/learned from the tutorial -->  
This tutorial focuses on the fundamentals of using Git version control, with GitHub being the platform used. This tutorial is definitely one of the most important skills that students should walk out with from this class, before entering job environment, or even taking higher level project-based classes. It is a widely used version control system, with and incredible ease of use. As for the content, the tutorial put an emphais on how to push commits, pull any changes from the remote repo, make sure everything is updated both locally and remotely, and in the worst case how to solve merge conflict if it ever happens.

### Challenges  

__[Challenge 1: Applying Design Thinking](https://github.com/UCSD-ECE16/ece-16-fall-2021-fadli0029/blob/main/General/Lab0/Challenge1.md)__
<!--- your comments on what the challenge asks you to do -->  
This challenge requires students to apply the knowledge learned from tutorial 1 by choosing a user of interest, identify the task they perform, start asking questions which allow us to see potential problems associated with the task, and ultimately come up with problem statement that could lead to a possible reliable solution. Students should also make their best attempt to demonstrate the principles of need finding as highlighted in the challenge. I choose Autonomous Vehicles companies as my user of interest, and making self-driving cars as the task they perform; the entire write-up is in [challenge1.md](https://github.com/UCSD-ECE16/ece-16-fall-2021-fadli0029/blob/main/General/Lab0/Challenge1.md)

__Challenge 2: Setting Up Git Repo__  
<!--- your comments on what the challenge asks you to do -->  
In this challenge, we were required to set up a git repo for use of all the class's labs materials, this includes source codes, lab reports, and etc. We applied one of the two methods to initate a local repo, I use the git clone method and then make the directories myself, according to how the directory structure stated in the challenge. I also added Arduino and Python directory, as they were not initially there. Hence, I created placeholder files, and push it to the repo.
